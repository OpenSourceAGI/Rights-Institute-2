# **Concise Arbitration Clause for W-9 and Employee Dispute Resolution Using Rapid Ruling**

**"Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement, the employment relationship, compensation, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, including but not limited to claims involving employment status, wages, harassment, discrimination, wrongful termination, or breach of contract, shall be settled by arbitration administered by Mediation and Civil Arbitration, Inc. d/b/a RapidRuling (www.rapidruling.com) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration shall be Dallas, Texas and any hearing shall be held via video or telephone conference. The parties consent to electronic service of process to [COMPANY EMAIL ADDRESS] and [WORKER/EMPLOYEE EMAIL ADDRESS], and all service may come from efile@rapidruling.com. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof."**[1]

**Cost Structure and Process:** Filing fees range from **$275 (claims up to $50,000) to $1,200 (claims $1M-$1.25M)**, with arbitrator fees at **$300/hour** (first 30 minutes included). Additional costs include Answer Fees ($75-$150), Request for Hearing ($500), and various motion fees ($25-$350). All evidence must be submitted through Rapid Ruling's **eFile Portal** at https://efile.rapidruling.com, supporting documents, photos, videos, and other multimedia evidence from any device. The process includes electronic filing, optional live hearings via video/phone conference, and legally binding decisions typically rendered within **21-30 days** depending on claim size.[1]

**Key Features:** The arbitration process is **100% online**, eliminating travel and reducing costs compared to traditional litigation. Hearings are conducted via telephone, GoogleMeet, or Zoom platforms with minimal physical interaction required. For claims under $1M, a single arbitrator is appointed with a 7-day objection period, while larger claims may request a three-arbitrator panel. Discovery is limited for smaller claims but full Federal Rules of Civil Procedure discovery is available for claims over $1M upon good cause shown. All proceedings are private and confidential, with decisions being legally binding and enforceable in any court with jurisdiction.[1]

**Timeline and Enforcement:** Rapid Ruling resolves disputes in **weeks instead of months or years** compared to traditional courts, with an 80% agreement rate. The process includes initial case submission, online hearing scheduling, and final decision delivery within 21-30 days of hearing closure. Emergency injunctive relief and interim orders are available, and arbitrators retain jurisdiction for up to 2 years post-settlement for enforcement purposes. This streamlined approach provides both W-9 contractors and employees with cost-effective dispute resolution while maintaining legal enforceability and procedural fairness.[1]
