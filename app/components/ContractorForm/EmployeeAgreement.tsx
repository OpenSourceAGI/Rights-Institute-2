        <p>The Company desires to employ the Employee, and the Employee wishes to enter into that employment, as set forth in this agreement.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>(a) Position</strong>. The Company hereby employs the Employee in the position of <strong>{position}</strong> and the Employee hereby accepts this employment as of the effective date (as defined in section 25, the <strong>"Effective Date"</strong>). During his or her employment with the Company, the Employee shall devote his or her best efforts and substantially all of his or her business time and attention (except for vacation periods and reasonable periods of illness or other incapacities permitted by the Company's general employment policies) to the business of the Company.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>(b) Duties.</strong> The Employee shall perform duties that are customarily associated with his or her then-current title, consistent with the {formData.employer_business_type === 'limited_liability_company' ? 'operating agreement' : formData.employer_business_type === 'corporation' ? 'bylaws' : 'organizing documents'} of the Company and as required by the Company. The Employee shall perform his or her duties at any place or places as the Company reasonably designates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>(c) Company Policies.</strong> The employment relationship between the parties will also be governed by the general employment policies and practices of the Company. If any terms of this agreement differ from or conflict with the Company's general employment policies or practices, this agreement will control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>(d) At-Will Status.</strong> THE EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY IS FOR AN UNSPECIFIED DURATION AND CONSTITUTES "AT-WILL" EMPLOYMENT. THE EMPLOYEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE OR FOR ANY OR NO CAUSE, AT THE OPTION OF EITHER THE COMPANY OR THE EMPLOYEE, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE.

            <strong>(a) Term.</strong> The term of this agreement will begin on <strong>{startDate}</strong> and continue until terminated by either party in accordance with subsection (b) or by law. The period during which the Employee is employed under this agreement is referred to as the "<strong>Employment Period</strong>."

            <strong>(b) Termination.</strong> Either party may, at any time, with or without cause, terminate this agreement by giving <strong>{notificationDays}</strong> days' written notice to the other party. If requested by the Company, the Employee shall continue to render his or her services pursuant to this agreement during this notice period, and will be paid his or her regular compensation until the last day of the Employee's employment (the <strong>"Termination Date"</strong>).
