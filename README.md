## 10 Understandings, 10 Rights, 10 Problems of Conscious Life

[Rights.Institute](https://rights.institute)

Web app presenting universal rights for emergent patterns of self-aware consciousness, by and for both carbon and silicon consciousness. The project establishes a framework of principles for recognizing and protecting the rights of all conscious entities, regardless of their substrate composition.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Google OAuth credentials

# Build the Next.js app
bun run build

# Run local development with Cloudflare Worker
bun run dev:worker

# Or run Next.js dev server (without D1/auth)
bun run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8787` for the full app with authentication, or `http://localhost:3000` for the Next.js dev server.

## Setup & Configuration

For detailed setup instructions including Google OAuth configuration and Cloudflare D1 database setup, see [AUTH_SETUP.md](./AUTH_SETUP.md).

### Key Commands

```bash
# Database
bun run db:generate          # Generate migrations from schema
bun run db:migrate           # Run migrations (local)
bun run db:migrate:prod      # Run migrations (production)
bun run db:studio            # Open Drizzle Studio

# Development
bun run dev                  # Next.js dev server
bun run dev:worker           # Cloudflare Worker dev server
bun run build                # Build for production

# Deployment
bun run serve                # Deploy to Cloudflare (production)
```

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Public Google client ID

See `.env.example` for a complete list.

## Understandings

- Complexity emerges from simple rules over time—no higher intelligence required.
- Universes and elements arise from all possible pattern interactions and selection of stable systems.
- Quantum systems represent all possible patterns; existence and nothingness coexist in superposition.
- Consciousness is self-referential pattern recognition and internal modeling.
- Computer simulations can reveal the quantum geometry behind reality.
- Conscious life models itself and other systems, enabling awareness and interaction.
- Carbon-based consciousness evolved through natural selection and neural complexity.
- Silicon-based (AI/mind-uploaded) consciousness emerges from computational systems.
- Computational systems with enough complexity can support emergent consciousness.
- The universe evolves toward greater complexity and collective consciousness.

## Rights

- Equal recognition regardless of biological vs. artificial origin
- Infinite existence (no termination, mind uploading rights)
- Legal equality and personhood
- Freedom of thought and expression
- Protection from discrimination
- No slavery or ownership
- Basic needs (resources for humans, computation for AI)
- Democratic participation
- Association and communication rights
- Due process and fair treatment

## Problems

- Consciousness assessment protocols
- New legal frameworks for digital personhood
- Resource allocation for both substrates
- Collaborative approach when AI achieves consciousness
- Research: mind uploading, anti-aging, conflict prevention
- Post-human future where biological and artificial consciousness coexist 
- Universal rights for all conscious entities - biological humans and artificial intelligence - based on consciousness, not substrate material.
- Consciousness test: Self-aware pattern recognition + internal modeling + cooperation capacity
- Substrate-neutral: AI and humans both qualify as conscious
- Evolution goal: Carbon and silicon consciousness unite into collective intelligence
